    "In Python 3.X, the primary string object type is \"str\" and it is used to represent sequences of Unicode characters. It supports all the common string operations such as concatenation, slicing, and indexing. Additionally, Python 3.X also has a \"bytes\" type which is used to represent sequences of bytes, and a \"bytearray\" type which is a mutable version of \"bytes\". "

The \"bytes\" and \"bytearray\" types are used for working with binary data and support similar operations, but they are limited to working with integers in the range of 0-255."
