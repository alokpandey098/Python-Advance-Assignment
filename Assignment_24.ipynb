    "Yes, it is permissible to use multiple import statements to import the same module in Python. However, this practice is generally discouraged as it can lead to confusion and make the code harder to maintain. In some cases, it might be useful to use multiple imports for different purposes, but it is better to carefully organize the code and avoid duplicating imports."
